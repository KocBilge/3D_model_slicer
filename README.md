- **Hole Punching:** Drill a hole at a specific point on the model.
- **Support Creation:** Add support on the sliced model.
- **Camera Control:** Observe the model from different angles.
- **Multiple Model Placement:** Place multiple models at certain intervals.
- **Overflow Indicator:** Check the overflow status of the model.

## What Can You Do?

- **Operations:** Perform operations such as rotating, slicing, drilling holes, and creating supports on the model through buttons and controls.
